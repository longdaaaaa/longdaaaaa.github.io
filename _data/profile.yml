    After my undergraduate graduation, I worked at a VC firm, where I conducted industry research in the technology sector to support investment decisions. Later, I joined a robotics start-up and participated in the design and development of their first robotic product.

    Then I started with a course-based MEng program at the University of Guelph. During this time, I had the opportunity to work on projects at the DIIM Lab, founded by Prof. Yang, and later transferred into the MASc program in my second year at U of G to begin research under his supervision. Since then, I have completed several projects and am actively working to turn them into publications. I also contributed to setting up experimental environments in the lab and supported fellow team members with their projects and manuscripts.
